node SharedKernel {

  [@RemoteService]
  [RemoteException]

}

node RestProxyCommon {
    [HttpClient]
}


package BusinessService {


    node ServiceApi {

    }

    node ServiceRest {
       [RestController]
    }
}

package ServiceConsumer {

    node BusinessModule{

    }

}

SharedKernel <-- RestProxyCommon

[RestController] -> ServiceApi : invokes
RestProxyClient -> ServiceApi : implements
ServiceCore -> ServiceApi : implements

BusinessModule --> RestProxyClient : uses
RestProxyClient --> RestProxyCommon : dependency
